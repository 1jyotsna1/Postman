Postman is an API client used to develop, test, share and document API's.

1. How to create the first API request
Create a new Collection and label it. Create a new request and save it in the Collection. Go the the saved request and enter a request URL. Choose the option GET and use a URL https://reqres.in/api/users/2 and hit send! 
The API will be observed at the Body in the Workspace. 


2. How to create Collection
Collection is a group of API requests where multiple API's can be stored and run in a logical arrangements. With Collections you can share, run and monitor multiple requests periodically.

To create a folder within a Collection
Click on create new Collection--> Go to options--> Add Folder--> To add a new request, click on add request-->To add an existing request, just drag and drop the request to the folder

To run a Collection with multiple requests
Save multiple requests in a folder within the Collection-->Click on run-->Run the folder


3. How to create variables
At the Collection level: Go to options under Collection--> Edit-->Go to Variables--> Create a variable under "Key" and assign it a value existing in the request--> Go to request and replace the value with {{variable name}}

At the Environment (To create variables globally): Go to Environment--> Edit global variables--> Create variables at the global level 


4. How to get and set variables in scripting

Go to a request where a variable is set--> Go to the 'Tests' section and write into the script the following to display a variable.

console.log('Hello world');
let Url=pm.variables.get("url");       //To get a variable
console.log('The URL is '+Url);

pm.variables.set("name","Postman");	//To set a new variable
let Name=pm.variables.get("name");      //To get a new variable
console.log('The name is '+Name);

pm.globals.set("Global", "New Variable");	//To set a new global variable
let globalVar=pm.globals.get("Global");   //To get a new global variable
console.log(globalVar);

pm.environment.set("Environment", "TokenEnvironment");  //To set a new environment
let envVar=pm.environment.get("Environment");     ////To get a new environment
console.log(envVar);


5. How to create an Environment
At the Environment level: Click on Manage Environment--> Add-->Name the Environment --> Create a variable under "Key" and assign it a value existing in the request--> Go to request and replace the value with {{variable name}}


6. How to POST a request
Take a sample API for posting a raw JSON body to it: https://reqres.in/api/register--> Under 'Body' paste the JSON code that has to be posted for eg. {
    "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
    "password": "pistol"
}

Under Header--> Body, the token will be generated.


7. How to use Script SNIPPETS
Go to any GET request-->Tests--> Click on any SNIPPETS which contain the code-->Run and observe the status in the Test Results below.


8. How to create and manage Workspaces
Workspace is an area where you can group, organize, and manage your collections


9. Data Driven Testing- How to use csv and JSON data files
Take a sample API for posting a raw JSON body to it: https://reqres.in/api/register--> Under 'Body' paste the JSON code that has to be posted for eg. {
    "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
    "password": "pistol"
}

Modify the request URL to https://reqres.in/api/register/preprod and POST it again-->The following output will appear in the Body:
{
    "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
    "password": "pistol",
    "id": "719",
    "createdAt": "2020-03-01T17:08:27.928Z"
}

Create Global variables in Manage Environment section:
endpoint: api/register/preprod
email: eve.holt@reqres.in
password: pistol

The request URL should look like this: https://reqres.in/{{endpoint}}
The script in the Body should be: {
    "email": "{{email}}",
    "password": "{{password}}"
}

Run this script to get the same output.

To import a csv file: Create multiple values under the key "endpoint", "email", "password" in a csv file--> Save the file and run the collection-->In Select File, import the csv file and run.

To import a JSON file: Create a JSON script and save it in .json--> Validate the JSON-->Save the file and run the collection-->In Select File, import the .json file and run.


10. How to get a value in Response and refer the same in Request
Create a GET request and add a request URL: For eg, https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2  --> and click send --> Observe the output at the body

Create a PUT request on another tab and add a request URL: https://reqres.in/api/users/2
Add this in the Body: {
    "name": "morpheus",
    "job": "zion resident"
}

Create a new environment and add Key variables named "Username" and "Number"and add any random initial value to it--> Update the Body of the PUT request to this:
{
    "name":"{{Username}}",
    "job": "{{Number}}"
}

Go to the Tests of the GET request and put this script and Save:

body=JSON.parse(responseBody)
value=body.data[0].first_name
console.log(value)
pm.environment.set("Username", value);

number=body.data[0].id
pm.environment.set("Number", number+1);
console.log(number+1)

Use http://jsonpathfinder.com/  to get syntax of a path of a variable to be found.

Conclusion: The value of the Username and Number at the GET request should be reflected in the results of the PUT request.

11. How to run from Command line
Check if node.js is already installed
	node -v

Install node.js
	Check if node and npm are installed
Install newman
	npm install -g newman
Export collection as a json file
	Go to the options of the Collection-->Export-->Save the JSON file in a location
	On command prompt, head to the location where the file is located and run the command: newman run "JSONfile"

newman run -h (will provide all options of running different commands with newman)
