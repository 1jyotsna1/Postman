9. Data Driven Testing- How to use csv and JSON data files
Take a sample API for posting a raw JSON body to it: https://reqres.in/api/register--> Under 'Body' paste the JSON code that has to be posted for eg. {
    "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
    "password": "pistol"
}

    "password": "pistol",
    "id": "719",
    "createdAt": "2020-03-01T17:08:27.928Z"
}

Create Global variables in Manage Environment section:
endpoint: api/register/preprod
email: eve.holt@reqres.in
password: pistol

The request URL should look like this: https://reqres.in/{{endpoint}}
The script in the Body should be: {
    "email": "{{email}}",
    "password": "{{password}}"
}

Run this script to get the same output.

To import a csv file: Create multiple values under the key "endpoint", "email", "password" in a csv file--> Save the file and run the collection-->In Select File, import the csv file and run.

To import a JSON file: Create a JSON script and save it in .json--> Validate the JSON-->Save the file and run the collection-->In Select File, import the .json file and run.
